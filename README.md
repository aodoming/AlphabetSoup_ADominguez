## DESCRIPTION
Exploring and implementing neural networks using the TensorFlow platform in Python. We explore the major costs and benefits of different neural networks and compare these costs to traditional machine learning classification and regression models. Additionally, we practice implementing neural networks and deep neural networks across a number of different datasets, including image, natural language, and numerical datasets. Finally, we learn how to store and retrieve trained models for more robust uses.

### SITUATION/TASK
Use a machine learning model and neural network model to build and predict the success of a venture paid by Alphabet Soup Company.
Create a binary classifier to project which applicants are likely to be successful if they received future funding from Alphabet Soup. 

### APPROACH
